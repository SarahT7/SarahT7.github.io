This is my GitHub repository for COMP2200 Portfolio 4.

I have chosen to analyse a dataset from the World Development Indicators database produced by The World Bank.

The purpose of this portfolio is to train machine learning models to predict Life Expectancy using World Development Indicators (WDI).

This portfolio will explore and visualise the WDI database, clean the data, discuss correlations between features, produce various machine learning models, analyse these models and assess their effectiveness.

Multiple machine learning models will be trained and analysed, including Logisitic Regression models, KNN models and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers.

The dataset will be explored, visualised and analysed as follows:
1. Exploring the dataset
2. Cleaning the dataset
3. Removing outliers
4. Exploring the cleaned dataset
5. Visualising the dataset
6. Exploring correlation between features
7. Training a Logistic Regression model
8. Using RFE to improve Logistic Regression model
9. Using Feature Importance to improve Logistic Regression model
10. Training a KNN model
11. Optimising KNN model by tuning hyperparameter k
12. Building a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier

The GaussianNB Model with optimised feature selection is the most accurate model trained in this portfolio. This model has a cross validated accuracy of 0.172 (+/- 0.052). The next best models are the feature selected Logistic Regression Model and KNN Model with optimised hyper parameter k, with cross validated accuracies of 0.148 (+/- 0.043) and 0.098 (+/- 0.035) respectively.

Despite the improvements made to each model throughout this portfolio, the most accurate model trained with an accuracy of 0.1611 will still be unable to effectively predict life expectancy based on the available features.
